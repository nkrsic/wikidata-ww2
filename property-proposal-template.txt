Proposed name:
(The name of the property, e.g. “Sacred site identifier”)

Data type:
(Choose one: Item, String, External identifier, URL, Quantity, Time, Monolingual text, Globe coordinate, etc.)

Domain (applicable to):
(Which kinds of items this property applies to — e.g. “applies to sacred places, temples, and monuments.”)

Allowed values / constraints:
(Optional — define allowed formats, regex patterns, or value ranges. E.g. “must be a positive integer”, or “must match [A–Z0–9]{1,15}”.)_

Motivation:
(Why this property is needed. What gap does it fill? Why can’t existing properties do the job? What use cases will it unlock — infoboxes, queries, external linking, etc. This section is critical.)

Examples:

Qxxxxxx (Example item) → [Proposed property] → (Example value)

Qyyyyyy (Another item) → [Proposed property] → (Example value)
